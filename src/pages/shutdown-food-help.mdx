# Shutdown Food Help

The current federal shutdown means that Pennsylvania SNAP payments won't go out until the shutdown is over.

I have created two new pages that have food sites only so you don't have to look through sites that are not offering food.

The full lists will still be available on their usual pages.

- [Food Sites Only - Map View](/food-map-view/)
- [Food Sites Only - List View](/food-list-view/)

You can also find more food sites using the [Share Food Program food finder](https://www.sharefoodprogram.org/find-food/) and the [City of Philadelphia food and meal finder](https://www.phila.gov/food/).
